1. What will be the values of all four condition flags after addb operation on two integers:
a) 11111111, 00000010
b) 01110001, 00101011

Note: the numbers are written in binary representation, and addb is an operation on two 8-bit integers.

a) Carry Flag - Set, Zero Flag - Clear, Sign Flag - Clear, Overflow Flag - Set
b) Carry Flag - Clear, Zero Flag - Clear, Sign Flag - Clear, Overflow Flag - Clear

2. 
A function with prototype: void foo(long x, long* y);
is compiled into assembly code, yielding the following:

foo:
	cmpq	$234, %rdi
	jle	.L2
	cmpq	$578, (%rsi)
	jg	.L2
	movq	$701, (%rsi)
.L2:
	ret

Write C code for foo that will have an effect equivalent to the assembly code shown. Be extra cautious about paranthesis in movq and cmpq.

void foo(long x, long* y){
	if(*y > 234)
	{
		return;
	}
	if(x > 578)
	{
		return;
	}
	x = 701;
}


3. What are the "maximum" number of stack frames of fibonacci() that will simultaneously exist at some point during the execution of fibonacci(6).
The code for fibonacci() is as follows:

long fibonacci(long n) {
    if(n<=2)
        return 1;
    else
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}

Maximum number of stack frames --> 15

4. What are the "total" number of stack frames of fibonacci() that will eventually be created during the execution of fibonacci(6).
Use same code as q3

Total number of stack frames --> 1
